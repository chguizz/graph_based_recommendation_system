# A graph-based recommendation system

(...work in progress...)  

Recommender systems are really well spread nowadays in web services such as Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and others. They are used for suggesting relatives items to users, thus leading industries to have more incomes and in general to stand out from the competitors when the algorithms applied are efficient. Here the project is based on using graph features and a GNN to implement a recommender system.  

### To do

- [X] data exploration  
- [X] centrality metrics  
- [X] GNN base model
- [X] GNN, different hyperparameters
- [X] Node2Vec
- [ ] report
